<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>A. Keith Palmer</h2>
<h3>Lucious Lyon</h3>
<h4>Phoenix Arizona</h4>
<p> I am a technician. By that, I mean to say. Anything involving technology is my passion. I am a student of Big Data,
  Cloud, IoT, Predictive Analytics, AI, and Machine Learning.
  Along with everything that relates to computers. From software development to Cyber Security. Web 3, crypto currency,
  etc. </p>



<p> My mentor is nonother than Kirk Borne, Ph.D. Principal Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton (since 2015). He
  supports the Strategic Innovation Group in NextGen Analytics.</p>
<p is of the Top 5 Data Scientists in the world. He is #1. When I was first introduced to him. I was surprised by this
  down-to-earth personality. Despite having a peripheral of degrees from various Universities. He has mentored me along
  my journey to becoming a Data Scientist myself.<p </body>
